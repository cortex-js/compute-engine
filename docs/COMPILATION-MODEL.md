# Compilation Model

**Status:** normative internal reference for implemented compilation behavior.

## Fail closed

Compilation is an optional acceleration route. A target emits code only when
it can preserve the interpreter's value, effects, evaluation count, and error
contract. Unsupported heads, representations, guards, or numeric lanes decline
with a structured diagnostic. They never emit plausible but different code.

With fallback enabled, a decline returns an interpreted runner. With fallback
disabled, the decline is visible to the caller. Runtime exceptions from
successfully compiled user code are not silently reinterpreted.

One value carve-out is ruled (pole-encoding ruling, 2026-08-28): where the
interpreter answers the projective infinity `~oo` — a division pole, a Gamma
or Factorial pole, an embedded `~oo` constant — a float-only target answers
the IEEE `Infinity` instead of declining. The projection keeps the infinite
magnitude and drops the direction `~oo` never had; it is what the bare
division instruction already answers at a runtime pole, so folded and
runtime spellings of the same pole agree. `NaN` remains reserved for the
genuinely indeterminate (`0/0`, `0 · ∞`) and for NaN propagation under
Contract B's `propagate` policy.

The projection is applied where the pole is spelled, not at the result
boundary, so a SIGNED cofactor can give the two routes different signs:
`-2 · (-1)!` folds as a whole to the interpreter's `~oo` and embeds
`+Infinity`, while the structural lowering computes `-2 · Infinity` and
answers `-Infinity`. Both agree on the infinite magnitude, which is the
promise; the sign is the direction `~oo` does not have, and a float lane
may report either. Code that must not see a signed answer at a pole should
test `Number.isFinite`, never the sign.

## Target boundaries

The JavaScript target supports the broadest dynamic representation. Python,
GLSL, WGSL, interval, and other targets expose narrower capabilities and must
decline outside them. A feature implemented for JavaScript is not implicitly a
cross-target promise.

Values crossing the compiled boundary use the target ABI. Complex values use
the documented scalar-or-`{re, im}` convention; nested collections retain
their shape. Target entry checks reject values incompatible with the compiled
lane assumptions.

## Complex modes

`strict` preserves real-lane assumptions and declines on an incompatible
complex boundary. `complex` compiles wide numeric bindings through complex
kernels. `auto` first attempts strict mode and retries once in complex mode on
a lane mismatch. The result records its effective mode, promotion, escalation,
and diagnostic.

Unknown-sign radical operations are the promotion trigger. Real-only kernels
guard and project only where the model explicitly permits it. The deprecated
`complexPromotion` option is a compatibility shim, not separate semantics. The
`realOnly` option, which projected a compiled unit's RESULT to a real number
(or `NaN`) after the kernel had run, is removed: a compiled value whose
imaginary part is exactly zero is already returned as a plain number, so a
consumer tests `typeof v === 'number'` per sample and maps a `{re, im}` at its
own value boundary.

The remaining quiet-machine performance measurement is tracked in
`plans/2026-08-16-compile-complex-mode.md`.

## User functions and dispatch

Single and multi-clause functions compile once per artifact. Multi-clause
dispatch uses the same specificity order as the interpreter. If any required
guard cannot be expressed, the entire function declines; compiling a subset of
clauses would change dispatch.

Protocol calls resolve directly when static typing proves one implementation.
Dynamic JavaScript dispatch uses the receiver's runtime nominal tag. Targets
without the tag representation decline.

## Collections

Compiled broadcasting preserves the interpreter's strict lifted regime.
Compiled pairing preserves shortest-input semantics. `PointList`, elementwise
selection, Map lowering/fusion, exact-map proof, and collection callbacks must
retain evaluation-once and effect ordering.

Implicit Map compilation obeys the engine-wide `jit` gate. Exact-mode Map
compilation requires an explicit proof that native-number execution preserves
the requested exact result. Structural or ABI failures are cached at the
appropriate expression-instance boundary.

### GPU `At`

GPU `At` preserves the engine's 1-based indexing through a guarded target
projection. A statically sized real-scalar vector/array base and a scalar index
may lower; negative indices count from the end, while zero, out-of-range,
non-integer, and missing indices project to the target's NaN value. Literal
integer gathers may fold or lower when every selected element preserves
evaluation count. A discarded impure element forbids folding.

Dynamic gathers, runtime boolean masks, point-list bases, unknown extents, and
non-real element/index shapes decline. GLSL/WGSL bounds behavior is never
relied upon: the emitted helper guards before indexing. Aggregate widths and
index types are read from the GPU declaration frame when the boxed expression
itself is typed `unknown`.

## Sums and objects

A sum with representation-disjoint variants erases tags. A sum whose variants
overlap uses tagged JavaScript objects. Other targets decline unless they gain
an equivalent representation. Mutable boxed objects do not cross into compiled
code unless a target explicitly implements identity, slots, versioning, and
effects.

## CSE and naming

Common-subexpression elimination is region-based and must respect effects,
bindings, evaluation order, and target representation. Compiler-internal types
stay structurally opaque where importing boxed-expression types would create a
module cycle. The remaining CSE design work is in the active
`plans/2026-07-28-compile-cse-design.md`.
