# Architecture Docs

This directory contains internal architecture notes and refactor plans.

These documents are intended for maintainers and contributors. They describe
module boundaries, dependency direction, and implementation planning, and are
not a stable public API reference.

Recommended starting points:

- [`CURRENT-ARCHITECTURE.md`](./CURRENT-ARCHITECTURE.md) for the current module
  map and extension boundaries.
- [`ZERO-CYCLES-PLAN.md`](./ZERO-CYCLES-PLAN.md) for cycle-elimination status.
- [`PLAN.md`](./PLAN.md) for the consolidated roadmap.
