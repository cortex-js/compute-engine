## [Unreleased]

### New Features

- Expanded LaTeX dictionary with `\max`, `\min`, `\sup`, `\inf` and `\lim`
  functions
- Added `Supremum` and `Infimum` functions
- Compilation of `Block` expressions, local variables, return statements and
  conditionals `If`.
- Added numerical evaluation of limits with `Limit` functions and `NLimit`
  functions, using a Richardson Extrapolation.

```js
console.info(ce.parse("\\lim_{x\\to0} \\frac{\\sin x}{x}").N().json);
// -> 1

console.info(
  ce.box(["NLimit", ["Divide", ["Sin", "_"], "_"], 0]).evaluate().json
);
// -> 1

console.info(ce.parse("\\lim_{x\\to \\infty} \\cos \\frac{1}{x}").N().json);
// -> 1
```

- Added `Assign` and `Declare` functions to assign values to symbols and declare
  symbols with a domain.

- `Block` evaluations with local variables work now. For example:

```js
ce.box(["Block", ["Assign", "c", 5], ["Multiply", "c", 2]]).evaluate().json;
// -> 10
```

- You can return from the middle of a block with the `Return` statement:

```js
ce
  .box(["Block", ["Assign", "c", 5], ["Return", "c"], ["Multiply", "c", 2]])
  .evaluate().json;
// -> 5
```

- When decimal numbers are parsed they are interpreted as inexact numbers by
  default, i.e. "1.2" -> `{num: "1.2"}`. To force the number to be interpreted
  as a rational number, set `ce.latexOptions.parseNumbers = "rational"`. In that
  case, "1.2" -> `["Rational", 12, 10]`, an exact number.

### Improvements

- LaTeX parser: empty superscripts are now ignored, e.g. `4^{}` is interpreted
  as `4`.

## 0.17.0

**Release Date:** 2023-10-12

### Breaking Changes

- The `Nothing` domain has been renamed to `NothingDomain`
- The `Functions`, `Maybe`, `Sequence`, `Dictionary`, `List` and `Tuple` domain
  constructors have been renamed to `FunctionOf`, `OptArg`, `VarArg`,
  `DictionaryOf`, `ListOf` and `TupleOf`, respectively.
- Domains no longer require a `["Domain"]` expression wrapper, so for example
  `ce.box("Pi").domain` returns `"TranscendentalNumbers"` instead of
  `["Domain", "TranscendentalNumbers"]`.
- The `VarArg` domain constructor now indicates the presence of 0 or more
  arguments, instead of 1 or more arguments.
- The `MaybeBooleans` domain has been dropped. Use
  `["Union", "Booleans", "NothingDomain"]` instead.
- The `ce.defaultDomain` has been dropped. The domain of a symbol is now
  determined by the context in which it is used, or by the `ce.assume()` method.
  In some circumstances, the domain of a symbol can be `undefined`.

### New Features

- Symbolic derivatives of expressions can be calculated using the `D` function.
  For example, `ce.box(["D", ce.parse("x^2 + 3x + 1"), "x"]).evaluate().latex`
  returns `"2x + 3"`.

### Improvements

- Some frequently used expressions are now available as predefined constants,
  for example `ce.Pi`, `ce.True` and `ce.Numbers`.
- Improved type checking and inference, especially for functions with
  complicated or non-numeric signatures.

### Bugs Fixed

- Invoking a function repeatedly would invoke the function in the original scope
  rather than using a new scope for each invocation.

## 0.16.0

**Release Date:** 2023-09-29

### Breaking Changes

- The methods `ce.let()` and `ce.set()` have been renamed to `ce.declare()` and
  `ce.assign()` respectively.
- The method `ce.assume()` requires a predicate.
- The signatures of `ce.assume()` and `ce.ask()` have been simplified.
- The signature of `ce.pushScope()` has been simplified.
- The `expr.freeVars` property has been renamed to `expr.unknowns`. It returns
  the identifiers used in the expression that do not have a value associated
  with them. The `expr.freeVariables` property now return the identifiers used
  in the expression that are defined outside of the local scope and are not
  arguments of the function, if a function.

### New Features

- **Domain Inference** when the domain of a symbol is not set explicitly (for
  example with `ce.declare()`), the domain is inferred from the value of the
  symbol or from the context of its usage.

- Added `Assume`, `Identity`, `Which`, `Parse`, `N`, `Evaluate`, `Simplify`,
  `Domain`.

- Assignments in LaTeX: `x \\coloneq 42` produce `["Assign", "x", 42]`

- Added `ErfInv` (inverse error function)

- Added `Factorial2` (double factorial)

### Functions

- Functions can now be defined:

  - using `ce.assign()` or `ce.declare()`
  - evaluating LaTeX: `(x, y) \\mapsto x^2 + y^2`
  - evaluating MathJSON:
    `["Function", ["Add", ["Power", "x", 2], ["Power", "y", 2]]], "x", "y"]`

- Function can be applied using `\operatorname{apply}` or the operators `\rhd`
  and `\lhd`:
  - `\operatorname{apply}(f, x)`
  - `f \rhd x`
  - `x \lhd f`

See
[Adding New Definitions](https://cortexjs.io/compute-engine/guides/augmenting/)
and [Functions](https://cortexjs.io/compute-engine/reference/functions/).

### Control Structures

- Added `FixedPoint`, `Block`, `If`, `Loop`
- Added `Break`, `Continue` and `Return` statements

See
[Control Structures](https://cortexjs.io/compute-engine/reference/control-structures/)

#### Calculus

- Added numeric approximation of derivatives, using an 8-th order centered
  difference approximation, with the `ND` function.
- Added numeric approximation of integrals, using a Monte Carlo method with
  rebasing for improper integrals, with the `NIntegrate` function
- Added symbolic calculation of derivatives with the `D` function.

#### Collections

Added support for **collections** such as lists, tuples, ranges, etc...

See [Collections](https://cortexjs.io/compute-engine/reference/collections/)

Collections can be used to represent various data structures, such as lists,
vectors, matrixes and more.

They can be iterated, sliced, filtered, mapped, etc...

```json example
["Length", ["List", 19, 23, 5]]
// -> 3

["IsEmpty", ["Range", 1, 10]]
// -> "False"

["Take", ["Linspace", 0, 100, 50], 4]
// -> ["List", 0, 2, 4, 6]

["Map", ["List", 1, 2, 3], ["Function", "x", ["Power", "x", 2]]]
// -> ["List", 1, 4, 9]

["Exclude", ["List", 33, 45, 12, 89, 65], -2, 2]
// -> ["List", 33, 12, 65]


["First", ["List", 33, 45, 12, 89, 65]]
// -> 33
```

### Improvements

- The documentation at https://cortexjs.io/compute-engine/ has been
  significantly rewritten with help from an AI-powered writing assistant.

### Bug Fixes

- The LaTeX string returned in `["Error"]` expression was incorrectly tagged as
  `Latex` instead of `LatexString`.

## 0.15.0

**Release Date:** 2023-09-14

### Improvements

- The `ce.serialize()` function now takes an optional `canonical` argument. Set
  it to `false` to prevent some transformations that are done to produce more
  readable LaTeX, but that may not match exactly the MathJSON. For example, by
  default `ce.serialize(["Power", "x", -1])` returns `\frac{1}{x}` while
  ce.serialize(["Power", "x", -1], {canonical: false}) returns`x^{-1}`.
- Improved parsing of delimiters, i.e. `\left(`, `\right]`, etc...
- Added complex functions `Real`, `Imaginary`, `Arg`, `Conjugate`, `AbsArg`. See
  https://cortexjs.io/compute-engine/reference/complex/
- Added parsing and evaluation of `\Re`, `\Im`, `\arg`, `^\star` (Conjugate).
- **#104** Added the `["ComplexRoots", x, n]` function which returns the nthroot
  of `x`.
- Added parsing and evaluation of statistics functions `Mean`, `Median`,
  `StandardDeviation`, `Variance`, `Skewness`, `Kurtosis`, `Quantile`,
  `Quartiles`, `InterquartileRange`, `Mode`, `Count`, `Erf`, `Erfc`. See
  https://cortexjs.io/compute-engine/reference/statistics/

## 0.14.0

**Release Date:** 2023-09-13

### Breaking Changes

- The entries in the LaTeX syntax dictionary can now have LaTeX triggers
  (`latexTrigger`) or triggers based on identifiers (`identifierTrigger`). The
  former replaces the `trigger` property. The latter is new. An entry with a
  `triggerIdentifier` of `average` will match `\operatorname{average}`,
  `\mathrm{average}` and other variants.
- The `ce.latexOptions` and `ce.jsonSerializationOptions` properties are more
  robust. They can be modified directly or one of their properties can be
  modified.

### Improvements

- Added more functions and symbols supported by `expr.compile()`:

  - `Factorial` postfix operator `5!`
  - `Gamma` function `\Gamma(2)`
  - `LogGamma` function `\operatorname{LogGamma}(2)`
  - `Gcd` function `\operatorname{gcd}(20, 5)`
  - `Lcm` function `\operatorname{lcm}(20, 5)`
  - `Chop` function `\operatorname{chop}(0.00000000001)`
  - `Half` constant `\frac{1}{2}`
  - 'MachineEpsilon' constant
  - `GoldenRatio` constant
  - `CatalanConstant` constant
  - `EulerGamma` constant `\gamma`
  - `Max` function `\operatorname{max}(1, 2, 3)`
  - `Min` function `\operatorname{min}(13, 5, 7)`
  - Relational operators: `Less`, `Greater`, `LessEqual`, `GreaterEqual`,
    'Equal', 'NotEqual'
  - Some logical operators and constants: `And`, `Or`, `Not`, `True`, `False`

- More complex identifiers syntax are recognized, including `\\mathbin{}`,
  `\\mathord{}`, etc... `\\operatorname{}` is the recommended syntax, though: it
  will display the identifier in upright font and with the propert spacing, and
  is properly enclosing. Some commands, such as `\\mathrm{}` are not properly
  enclosing: two adjacent `\\mathrm{}` command could be merged into one.

- Environments are now parsed and serialized correctly.

- When parsing LaTeX, function application is properly handled in more cases,
  including custom functions, e.g. `f(x)`
- When parsing LaTeX, multiple arguments are properly handled, e.g. `f(x, y)`

- Add LaTeX syntax for logical operators:

  - `And`: `\land`, `\operatorname{and}` (infix or function)
  - `Or`: `\lor`, `\operatorname{or}` (infix or function)
  - `Not`: `\lnot`, `\operatorname{not}` (prefix or function)
  - `Xor`: `\veebar` (infix)
  - `Nand`: `\barwedge` (infix)
  - `Nor`: `^^^^22BD` (infix)
  - `Implies`: `\implies` (infix)
  - `Equivalent`: `\iff` (infix)

- When a postfix operator is defined in the LaTeX syntax dictionary of the form
  `^` plus a single token, a definition with braces is added automatically so
  that both forms will be recognized.

- Extended the LaTeX dictionary with:

  - `floor`
  - `ceil`
  - `round`
  - `sgn`
  - `exp`
  - `abs`
  - `gcd`
  - `lcm`
  - `apply`

- Properly handle inverse and derivate notations, e.g. `\sin^{-1}(x)`,
  `\sin'(x)`, `\cos''(x)`, \cos^{(4)}(x)`or even`\sin^{-1}''(x)`

## 0.13.0

**Release Date:** 2023-09-09

### New Features

- Some expressions can be compiled to Javascript. This is useful to evaluate an
  expression many times, for example in a loop. The compiled expression is
  faster to evaluate than the original expression. To get the compiled
  expression, use `expr.compile()`. Read more at
  https://cortexjs.io/compute-engine/guides/compiling

### Bug Fixes and Improvements

- Fixed parsing and serialization of extended LaTeX synonyms for `e` and `i`.
- Fixed serialization of `Half`.
- Fixed serialization of `Which`
- Improved serialization of `["Delimiter"]` expressions.

## 0.12.7

**Release Date:** 2023-09-08

### Improvements

- Made customization of the LaTeX dictionary simpler. The `ce.latexDictionary`
  property can be used to access and modify the dictionary. The documentation at
  https://cortexjs.io/compute-engine/guides/latex-syntax/#customizing-the-latex-dictionary
  has been updated.

## 0.12.6

**Release Date:** 2023-09-08

### Breaking Changes

- New API for the `Parser` class.

### Improvements and Bux Fixes

- The `ComputeEngine` now exports the `bignum()` and `complex()` methods that
  can be used to create bignum and complex numbers from strings or numbers. The
  methods `isBigNum()` and `isComplex()` have also been added to check if a
  value is a bignum (`Decimal`) or complex (`Complex`) number, for example as
  returned by `expr.numericValue`.
- **#69** `\leq` was incorrectly parsed as `Equals` instead of `LessEqual`
- **#94** The `\exp` command was not parsed correctly.
- Handle `PlusMinus` in infix and prefix position, i.e. `a\pm b` and `\pm a`.
- Improved parsing, serialization
- Improved simplification
- Improved evaluation of `Sum` and `Product`
- Support complex identifiers (i.e. non-latin scripts, emojis).
- Fixed serialization of mixed numbers.

## 0.12.1

**Release Date:** 2022-12-01

Work around unpckg.com issue with libraries using BigInt.

## 0.12.0

**Release Date:** 2022-11-27

### Breaking Changes

- The `expr.symbols` property return an array of `string`. Previously it
  returned an array of `BoxedExpression`.

### Improvements

- Rewrote the rational computation engine to use JavaScript `bigint` instead of
  `Decimal` instances. Performance improvements of up to 100x.
- `expr.freeVars` provides the free variables in an expression.
- Improved performance of prime factorization of big num by x100.
- Added `["RandomExpression"]`
- Improved accuracy of some operations, for example
  `expr.parse("1e999 + 1").simplify()`

### Bug Fixes

- When `ce.numericMode === "auto"`, square roots of negative numbers would
  return an expression instead of a complex number.
- The formatting of LaTeX numbers when using
  `ce.latexOptions.notation = "engineering"` or `"scientific"` was incorrect.
- The trig functions no longer "simplify" to the less simple exponential
  formulas.
- The canonical order of polynomials now orders non-lexicographic terms of
  degree 1 last, i.e. "ax^2+ bx+ c" instead of "x + ax^2 + bx".
- Fixed evaluation of inverse functions
- Fixed `expr.isLess`, `expr.isGreater`, `expr.isLessEqual`,
  `expr.isGreaterEqual` and `["Min"]`, `["Max"]`

## 0.11.0

**Release Date:** 2022-11-18

### Breaking Changes

- The signature of `ce.defineSymbol()`, `ce.defineFunction()` and
  `ce.pushScope()` have changed

### Improvements

- When a constant should be held or substituted with its value can now be more
  precisely controlled. The `hold` symbol attribute is now `holdUntil` and can
  specify at which stage the substitution should take place.

### Bug Fixes

- Some constants would return a value as bignum or complex even when the
  `numericMode` did not allow it.
- Changing the value or domain of a symbol is now correctly taken into account.
  Changes can be made with `ce.assume()`, `ce.set()` or `expr.value`.
- When a symbol does not have a value associated with it, assumptions about it
  (e.g. "x > 0") are now correctly tracked and reflected.

## 0.10.0

**Release Date:** 2022-11-17

### Breaking Changes

- `expr.isLiteral` has been removed. Use `expr.numericValue !== null` and
  `expr.string !== null` instead.

### Bug Fixes

- Calling `ce.forget()` would not affect expressions that previously referenced
  the symbol.

### Improvements

- More accurate calculations of some trig functions when using bignums.
- Improved performance when changing a value with `ce.set()`. Up to 10x faster
  when evaluating a simple polynomial in a loop.
- `ce.strict` can be set to `false` to bypass some domain and validity checks.

## 0.9.0

**Release Date:** 2022-11-15

### Breaking Changes

- The head of a number expression is always `Number`. Use `expr.domain` to be
  get more specific info about what kind of number this is.
- By default, `ce.box()` and `ce.parse()` return a canonical expression. A flag
  can be used if a non-canonical expression is desired.
- The API surface of `BoxedExpression` has been reduced. The properties
  `machineValue`, `bignumValue`, `asFloat`, `asSmallInteger`, `asRational`
  etc... have been replaced with a single `numericValue` property.
- `parseUnknownSymbol` is now `parseUnknownIdentifier`

### Improvements

- Support angles in degrees with `30\degree`, `30^\circ` and `\ang{30}`.
- More accurate error expressions, for example if there is a missing closing
  delimiter an `["Error", ["ErrorCode", "'expected-closing-delimiter'", "')'"]]`
  is produced.
- `["Expand"]` handles more cases
- The trig functions can now have a regular exponent, i.e.`\cos^2(x)` in
  addition to `-1` for inverse, and a combination of `\prime`, `\doubleprime`
  and `'` for derivatives.
- `ce.assume()` handle more expressions and can be used to define new symbols by
  domain or value.
- Better error message when parsing, e.g. `\sqrt(2)` (instead of `\sqrt{2}`)
- Better simplification for square root expressions:
  - `\sqrt{25x^2}` -> `5x`
- Improved evaluation of `["Power"]` expressions, including for negative
  arguments and non-integer exponents and complex arguments and exponents.
- Added `Arccot`, `Arcoth`, `Arcsch`, `Arcscc`, `Arsech` and `Arccsc`
- `expr.solve()` returns result for polynomials of order up to 2.
- The `pattern.match()` function now work correctly for commutative functions,
  i.e. `ce.pattern(['Add', '_a', 'x']).match(ce.parse('x+y')) -> {"_a": "y"}`
- Added `ce.let()` and `ce.set()` to declare and assign values to identifiers.
- Preserve exact calculations involving rationals or square root of rationals.
  - `\sqrt{\frac{49}{25}}` -> `\frac{7}{5}`
- Addition and multiplication provide more consistent results for `evaluate()`
  and `N()`. Evaluate returns an exact result when possible.

  - EXACT
    - 2 + 5 -> 7
    - 2 + 5/7 -> 19/7
    - 2 + √2 -> 2 + √2
    - 2 + √(5/7) -> 2 + √(5/7)
    - 5/7 + 9/11 -> 118/77
    - 5/7 + √2 -> 5/7 + √2
    - 10/14 + √(18/9) -> 5/7 + √2
    - √2 + √5 -> √2 + √5
    - √2 + √2 -> 2√2
    - sin(2) -> sin(2)
    - sin(π/3) -> √3/2
  - APPROXIMATE
    - 2 + 2.1 -> 4.1
    - 2 + √2.1 -> 3.44914
    - 5/7 + √2.1 -> 2.16342
    - sin(2) + √2.1 -> 2.35844

- More consistent behavior of the `auto` numeric mode: calculations are done
  with `bignum` and `complex` in most cases.
- `JsonSerializationOptions` has a new option to specify the numeric precision
  in the MathJSON serialization.
- Shorthand numbers can now be strings if they do not fit in a float-64:

```json example
// Before
["Rational", { "num": "1234567890123456789"}, { "num": "2345678901234567889"}]

// Now
["Rational", "1234567890123456789", "2345678901234567889"]
```

- `\sum` is now correctly parsed and evaluated. This includes creating a local
  scope with the index and expression value of the sum.

### Bugs Fixed

- The parsing and evaluation of log functions could produce unexpected results
- The `\gamma` command now correctly maps to `["Gamma"]`
- Fixed numeric evaluation of the `["Gamma"]` function when using bignum
- **#57** Substituting `0` (i.e. with `expr.subs({})`) did not work.
- **#60** Correctly parse multi-char symbols with underscore, i.e.
  `\mathrm{V_a}`
- Parsing a number with repeating decimals and an exponent would drop the
  exponent.
- Correct calculation of complex square roots
  - `\sqrt{-49}` -> `7i`
- Calculations were not always performed as bignum in `"auto"` numeric mode if
  the precision was less than 15. Now, if the numeric mode is `"auto"`,
  calculations are done as bignum or complex numbers.
- If an identifier contained multiple strings of digits, it would not be
  rendered to LaTeX correctly, e.g. `V20_20`.
- Correctly return `isReal` for real numbers

## 0.8.0

**Release Date:** 2022-10-02

### Breaking Changes

- Corrected the implementation of `expr.toJSON()`, `expr.valueOf()` and added
  the esoteric `[Symbol.toPrimitive]()` method. These are used by JavaScript
  when interacting with other primitive types. A major change is that
  `expr.toJSON()` now returns an `Expression` as an object literal, and not a
  string serialization of the `Expression`.

- Changed from "decimal" to "bignum". "Decimal" is a confusing name, since it is
  used to represent both integers and floating point numbers. Its key
  characteristic is that it is an arbitrary precision number, aka "bignum". This
  affects `ce.numericMode` which now uses `bignum` instead of
  `decimal', `expr.decimalValue`->`expr.bignumValue`, `decimalValue()`-> `bignumValue()`

### Bugs Fixed

- Numerical evaluation of expressions containing complex numbers when in
  `decimal` or `auto` mode produced incorrect results. Example: `e^{i\\pi}`

## 0.7.0

**Release Date:** 2022-09-30

### Breaking Changes

- The `ce.latexOptions.preserveLatex` default value is now `false`
- The first argument of the `["Error"]` expression (default value) has been
  dropped. The first argument is now an error code, either as a string or an
  `["ErrorCode"]` expression.

### Features

- Much improved LaTeX parser, in particular when parsing invalid LaTeX. The
  parser now avoids throwing, but will return a partial expression with
  `["Error"]` subexpressions indicating where the problems were.
- Implemented new domain computation system (similar to type systems in
  programming languages)
- Added support for multiple signatures per function (ad-hoc polymorphism)
- Added `FixedPoint`, `Loop`, `Product`, `Sum`, `Break`, `Continue`, `Block`,
  `If`, `Let`, `Set`, `Function`, `Apply`, `Return`
- Added `Min`, `Max`, `Clamp`
- Parsing of `\sum`, `\prod`, `\int`.
- Added parsing of log functions, `\lb`, `\ln`, `\ln_{10}`, `\ln_2`, etc...
- Added
  `expr.`subexpressions`, `expr.getSubexpressions()`, `expr.errors`, `expr.symbols`, `expr.isValid`.
- Symbols can now be used to represent functions, i.e. `ce.box('Sin').domain`
  correctly returns `["Domain", "Function"]`.
- Correctly handle rational numbers with a numerator or denominator outside the
  range of a 64-bit float.
- Instead of a `Missing` symbol an `["Error", "'missing'"]` expression is used.
- Name binding is now done lazily
- Correctly handle MathJSON numbers with repeating decimals, e.g. `1.(3)`.
- Correctly evaluate inverse functions, e.g. `ce.parse('\\sin^{-1}(.5)).N()`
- Fixed some LaTeX serialization issues

[Core Reference](https://cortexjs.io/compute-engine/reference/core/) and
[Arithmetic Reference]
(https://cortexjs.io/compute-engine/reference/arithmetic/)

### Bugs Fixed

- **#43** If the input of `ce.parse()` is an empty string, return an empty
  string for `expr.latex` or `expr.json.latex`: that is, ensure verbatim LaTeX
  round-tripping
- Evaluating some functions, such as `\arccos` would result in a crash
- Correctly handle parsing of multi-token decimal markers, e.g. `{,}`

## 0.6.0

**Release Date:** 2022-04-18

### Improvements

- Parse more cases of tabular environments
- Handle simplify and evaluate of inert functions by default
- Avoid unnecessary wrapping of functions when serializing LaTeX
- Parse arguments of LaTeX commands (e.g. `\vec{}`)
- **#42** Export static `ComputeEngine.getLatexDictionary`
- Parse multi-character constants and variables, e.g. `\mathit{speed}` and
  `\mathrm{radius}`
- Parse/serialize some LaTeX styling commands: `\displaystyle`, `\tiny` and more

## 0.5.0

**Release Date:** 2022-04-05

### Improvements

- Correctly parse tabular content (for example in
  `\begin{pmatrix}...\end{pmatrix}`
- Correctly parse LaTeX groups, i.e. `{...}`
- Ensure constructible trigonometric values are canonical
- Correct and simplify evaluation loop for `simplify()`, `evaluate()` and `N()`.
- **#41** Preserve the parsed LaTeX verbatim for top-level expressions
- **#40** Correctly calculate the synthetic LaTeX metadata for numbers
- Only require Node LTS (16.14.2)
- Improved documentation, including Dark Mode support

## 0.4.4

**Release Date**: 2022-03-27

### Improvements

- Added option to specify custom LaTeX dictionaries in `ComputeEngine`
  constructor
- `expr.valueOf` returns rational numbers as `[number, number]` when applicable
- The non-ESM builds (`compute-engine.min.js`) now targets vintage JavaScript
  for improved compatibility with outdated toolchains (e.g. Webpack 4) and
  environments. The ESM build (`compute-engine.min.esm.js`) targets evergreen
  JavaScript (currently ECMAScript 2020).

## 0.4.3

**Release Date**: 2022-03-21

### Transition Guide from 0.4.2

The API has changed substantially between 0.4.2 and 0.4.3, however adapting code
to the new API is very straightforward.

The two major changes are the introduction of the `BoxedExpression` class and
the removal of top level functions.

### Boxed Expression

The `BoxedExpression` class is a immutable box (wrapper) that encapsulates a
MathJSON `Expression`. It provides some member functions that can be used to
manipulate the expression, for example `expr.simplify()` or `expr.evaluate()`.

The boxed expresson itself is immutable. For example, calling `expr.simplify()`
will return a new, simplified, expression, without modifying `expr`.

To create a "boxed" expression from a "raw" MathJSON expression, use `ce.box()`.
To create a boxed expression from a LaTeX string, use `ce.parse()`.

To access the "raw" MathJSON expression, use the `expr.json` property. To
serialize the expression to LaTeX, use the `expr.latex` property.

The top level functions such as `parse()` and `evaluate()` are now member
functions of the `ComputeEngine` class or the `BoxedExpression` class.

There are additional member functions to examine the content of a boxed
expression. For example, `expr.symbol` will return `null` if the expression is
not a MathJSON symbol, otherwise it will return the name of the symbol as a
string. Similarly, `expr.ops` return the arguments (operands) of a function,
`expr.asFloat` return `null` if the expression does not have a numeric value
that can be represented by a float, a `number` otherwise, etc...

### Canonical Form

Use `expr.canonical` to obtain the canonical form of an expression rather than
the `ce.format()` method.

The canonical form is less aggressive in its attempt to simplify than what was
performed by `ce.format()`.

The canonical form still accounts for distributive and associative functions,
and will collapse some integer constants. However, in some cases it may be
necessary to invoke `expr.simplify()` in order to get the same results as
`ce.format(expr)`.

### Rational and Division

In addition to machine floating points, arbitrary precision numbers and complex
numbers, the Compute Engine now also recognize and process rational numbers.

This is mostly an implementation detail, although you may see
`["Rational", 3, 4]`, for example, in the value of a `expr.json` property.

If you do not want rational numbers represented in the value of the `.json`
property, you can exclude the `Rational` function from the serialization of JSON
(see below) in which case `Divide` will be used instead.

Note also that internally (as a result of boxing), `Divide` is represented as a
product of a power with a negative exponent. This makes some pattern detection
and simplifications easier. However, when the `.json` property is accessed,
product of powers with a negative exponents are converted to a `Divide`, unless
you have included `Divide` as an excluded function for serialization.

Similarly, `Subtract` is converted internally to `Add`, but may be serialized
unless excluded.

### Parsing and Serialization Customization

Rather than using a separate instance of the `LatexSyntax` class to customize
the parsing or serialization, use a `ComputeEngine` instance and its
`ce.parse()` method and the `expr.latex` property.

Custom dictionaries (to parse/serialize custom LaTeX syntax) can be passed as an
argument to the `ComputeEngine` constructor.

For more advanced customizations, use `ce.latexOptions = {...}`. For example, to
change the formatting options of numbers, how the invisible operator is
interpreted, how unknown commands and symbols are interpreted, etc...

Note that there are also now options available for the "serialization" to
MathJSON, i.e. when the `expr.json` property is used. It is possible to control
for example if metadata should be included, if shorthand forms are allowed, or
whether some functions should be avoided (`Divide`, `Sqrt`, `Subtract`, etc...).
These options can be set using `ce.jsonSerializationOptions = {...}`.

### Comparing Expressions

There are more options to compare two expressions.

Previously, `match()` could be used to check if one expression matched another
as a pattern.

If `match()` returned `null`, the first expression could not be matched to the
second. If it returned an object literal, the two expressions matched.

The top-level `match()` function is replaced by the `expr.match()` method.
However, there are two other options that may offer better results:

- `expr.isSame(otherExpr)` return true if `expr` and `otherExpr` are
  structurally identical. Structural identity is closely related to the concept
  of pattern matching, that is `["Add", 1, "x"]` and `["Add", "x", 1]` are not
  the same, since the order of the arguments is different. It is useful for
  example to compare some input to an answer that is expected to have a specific
  form.
- `expr.isEqual(otherExpr)` return true if `expr` and `otherExpr` are
  mathematically identical. For example `ce.parse("1+1").isEqual(ce.parse("2"))`
  will return true. This is useful if the specific structure of the expression
  is not important.

It is also possible to evaluate a boolean expression with a relational operator,
such as `Equal`:

```ts
console.log(ce.box(["Equal", expr, 2]).evaluate().symbol);
// -> "True"

console.log(expr.isEqual(ce.box(2)));
// -> true
```
