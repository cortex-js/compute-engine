# Declarations

A declaration introduces a symbol into the current scope. Epsil has two
declaration keywords:

- **`let`** declares a **mutable** symbol.
- **`const`** declares an **immutable** symbol.

```epsil
let x = 5
const c = 6.28
```

Reach for `const` when the name stands for something fixed — a physical
constant, a conversion factor, a lookup table — so that an accidental write is
reported. Use `let` for anything that varies: accumulators, loop state, 
values you refine as you go.

A type annotation also **implies** a declaration, even without a keyword:

```epsil
x: real = 5
```

is a declaration of `x` with type `real`, exactly as if it had been written
`let x: real = 5`. The keyword is only mandatory for an **untyped**
declaration — that's what distinguishes a declaration from a plain
reassignment (see below).

## Destructuring declarations

A `let` or `const` may bind the components of a **tuple** in one statement:

```epsil
divmod(a, b) = (Floor(a / b), a % b)
let (q, r) = divmod(17, 5)
(q, r)
// ➔ (3, 2)
```

The pattern is a parenthesized list of **at least two** elements, each a bare
symbol, a `_` (which skips that position), or a nested tuple pattern:

```epsil
let ((a, b), _, c) = ((1, 2), 99, 5)
a + b + c
// ➔ 8
```

The pattern is **irrefutable in form** — no literals, pins, or guards (use
[`match`](/epsil/control-flow/) for conditional destructuring). The value is
evaluated once; it must be a tuple of the same shape, otherwise the
declaration yields an `incompatible-type` **error value** and binds nothing.
With `const`, every bound name is a constant. An initializer is required, and
a type annotation is not accepted on a pattern. Duplicate names anywhere in
one pattern are a diagnostic.

## Destructuring assignment

The same pattern may appear on the left of an assignment, to write bindings
that already exist instead of declaring new ones:

```epsil
let a = 1
let b = 2
(a, b) := (b, a)
(a, b)
// ➔ (2, 1)
```

The right side is evaluated **once, in full, before any target is written**,
so a swap means what it reads — `(a, b) := (b, a)` exchanges the two values
rather than assigning `b` to both. The same holds for a rotation
(`(a, b, c) := (c, a, b)`) and for the pair-carrying loop step that is the
usual reason to want this:

```epsil
let a = 0
let b = 1
for k in 1..10 {
  (a, b) := (b, a + b)
}
a
// ➔ 55
```

The pattern grammar is exactly the one above — at least two elements, each a
bare symbol, a `_` skipping that position, or a nested tuple pattern — and a
shape mismatch is the same `incompatible-type` error value, which writes
**nothing**: the whole pattern is matched before any target is written, so a
mismatch nested under a position that would have bound leaves that one alone
too.

The differences from a destructuring `let` are the ones assignment always has:
the targets keep their identity and their declared type (a value that does not
fit a target's type is an error value), and assigning to a `const` fails.
Those two failures are found only by attempting the write, so unlike a shape
mismatch they are **not** atomic — targets earlier in the pattern have already
been written and stay written.

The assignment operator must be spelled `:=`. A statement-leading `(a, b) = …`
is a **comparison**, not an assignment — a parenthesized left side is not a
binding target, so the bare `=` reads as `Equal`. Because that is almost
always a typo for the destructuring assignment, it is
[diagnosed](/epsil/operators/).

## Declaring a type

A third declaration keyword, `type`, introduces a **type** name rather than a
symbol — and, with it, a constructor of the same name:

```epsil
type point = tuple<x: number, y: number>
type alias pair = tuple<number, number>
let p = point(1, 2)
let a: pair = (1, 2)
```

`type` declares a new, distinct type; `type alias` declares another name for
an existing one, and takes a type-parameter clause if it needs one
(`type alias Pair<T> = tuple<T, T>`). Unlike `let` and `const`, `type` is not
a reserved word — only these statement shapes claim it. See
[Declaring a type](/epsil/types/#declaring-a-type) for the whole story.

## Function-type annotations bind their parameter names

A parameter name **binds wherever it appears**. When a declaration's
annotation is a function type written out at the declaration site with named
parameters, those names become the parameters of the declared function — the
initializer is its **body**:

```epsil
const f : (x: number) -> number = x^2 + 2x + 1
f(3)
// ➔ 16
```

This is the same function as `= (x) => x^2 + 2x + 1`, and the same as the
definition form `f(x: number) -> number = x^2 + 2x + 1`. The initializer may
instead be an explicit lambda; the annotation's names must then agree with the
lambda's (a disagreement is a diagnostic, with a fixit) — or leave the
annotation's parameters unnamed, and let the lambda name them:

```epsil
const g : (number) -> number = (x) => x + 1
```

So a name appears in **one** place (or in both, agreeing) — never with two
meanings. These declared names are also what callers use to pass
[named arguments](/epsil/syntax/#named-arguments) — `f(x: 3)` — so
renaming a parameter is a visible change to the function's interface. When the annotation is named, the initializer is read as a pointwise
*body*; when it is unnamed, the initializer must *be* a function value, as in
`const h : (number) -> number = g`.

The names bind only where they are **written**: an annotation through a
`type alias` never binds (its names are documentation), a zero-parameter
signature has nothing to bind (`const t : () -> number = makeCounter()` keeps
meaning what it says), and for a curried signature only the **outermost**
arrow binds — `const add : (x: number) -> (y: number) -> number = (y) => x + y`
binds `x` around an explicit inner lambda. Generic (a `where` clause), effectful,
optional/variadic, and partially named signatures do not bind either; give
those an explicit lambda.

## Reassignment vs. declaration

A bare `x = 5` — no `let`/`const` keyword, no type annotation — is not
declaration syntax: it is an **assignment**:

```epsil
x = 5
```

Assigning to a name that was never declared does establish it, but `let` is
the explicit and idiomatic way to introduce a mutable binding.

Reassigning a symbol that was declared `const` produces an
[error value](/epsil/evaluation/#errors-are-values), not a parse error or a
thrown exception:

```epsil
const c = 1
c = 2
```

`c = 2` still parses as a perfectly ordinary assignment; the failure happens at
evaluation time, and its result is an error value.

A declaration with no initializer declares the name without giving it a value:

```epsil
let x: real
let y
```

Without an annotation, the type is inferred from the initializer — `let x = 5`
declares `x` as an `integer`.

Constness is a property of the **binding**, not of the type: `const` says that
*this name* will not be written again, and says nothing about the value it
holds — there is no such thing as a constant type. See
[Declarations](/epsil/implementation/#declarations) for the underlying
representation.

## Scoping

Declarations live in the current scope. A program (a notebook cell or a
chain of cells sharing one engine scope) declares at the top level; a block
introduced by `if`/`else`/`while`/`for`, or a function body, pushes its own
lexical scope, so a `let`/`const` inside a block does not leak into the
enclosing scope.

[Type declarations](/epsil/types/) are the exception: types (and their
constructors) are **global** — a `type` statement is only allowed at the top
level of a program, and the declared name means the same thing everywhere on
the engine.

`let` and `const` are the binding keywords. There is currently no compound
assignment (`+=`); destructuring declarations (`let (x, y) = t`) and
destructuring assignments (`(x, y) := t`) are described above.
