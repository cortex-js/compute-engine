# Compute Engine — Roadmap

**Last updated:** 2026-06-13. Items 2 (interruptible evaluation), 4
(Tier-2 numeric kernels), 9 (₂F₁ analytic continuation), 10 (x/√(x²)
soundness), 11 (deadline checks in simplify), 12 (antiderivative
correctness), 13 (small engine follow-ups), 14 (incomplete elliptic
integrals), 15 (fractional-power principal-branch soundness), and 16
(factor()↔mul canonicalization loop + `x^(-1/2)` unification)
completed — prerequisites for the Rubi integration (`docs/rubi/RUBI.md`).

**Rubi status (the consumer driving items 2/4/10/15):** R1 cleared
(section 1.1.1 at 98.28%) and **R2 gate cleared** (full-Chapter-1 seeded
sample = 94.0%, ≥90% target). The driver hangs that had blocked the
exhaustive run are **resolved** (an engine `factor()`↔canonical-`mul`
infinite loop — fixed in `factor.ts`; see the scope note under item 2 and
`docs/rubi/RUBI.md` §5). Rubi's own top next step is the exhaustive
25,854-problem run (now feasible). Engine-side, the next genuinely new
capability remains item 7 (analytic-property metadata store); items 1/5 are
the near-term Fungrim/dispatch follow-ons.

Context: the 2026-06 release shipped the Fungrim-derived identities library
(`@cortex-js/compute-engine/identities`, 1,376 rules), the complex-domain
assumptions extension (constraint subjects over `Re/Im/Abs/Arg`, set-membership
facts, fail-closed guard discharge), the operator-indexed rule dispatcher with
purpose tags, `ce.solveRules`/`ce.harmonizationRules`, exact `Zeta` evaluation,
and the full correctness/performance sweep from the June codebase review
(~120 findings + 15 follow-on discoveries, all dispositioned). This document
captures what comes next, in priority order, with enough context to start each
item cold.

Related documents: `docs/fungrim/FUNGRIM.md` (feasibility analysis and feature map A–E),
`docs/fungrim/FUNGRIM-PLAN-1…5` (executed plans for the translator, rule mechanics,
assumptions, and loader — useful as architecture references), `data/fungrim/`
(the translated corpus + manifest), `scripts/fungrim/` (translator-side tooling:
rule compiler, validation harness, guard census).

## Near-term

### 1. Fungrim Phase 2 — activate solve templates

**What:** promote the curated solve-template seeds (currently staged in
`scripts/fungrim/curation-overrides.json` behind `loadIdentities(ce, {solve:
true})`, off by default) into a supported capability, and mine the corpus's
inverse-composition entries (`f(g(x)) = x`) for more templates.

**Why now:** the G2 harmonization fix changed the economics. Before it, solve's
harmonization pass was provably inert (the `_x` binding mismatch); now
harmonization rules chain (depth 4), injective wrappers peel off `Equal`, and
`validateRoots` checks every candidate against the original equation — so an
over-eager template degrades to a no-op, never a wrong answer. Solve templates
compose with all of that.

**How:** flip the seed set (LambertW `8654a3`, Ln/Exp `4c1e1e`/`296627`,
Tan/Arctan `1f026d`/`f516e3`) into the default artifact via the overrides
`inject`/`target: 'solve'` path (the mechanism already exists in
`compile-rules.ts`); add corpus mining for `class: identity` entries of the
inverse-composition shape; acceptance via `solve-rules.test.ts` extensions
(e.g. `x·eˣ = 3 → W(3)`). Consider the "general solution families" follow-on
(`x = arctan(c) + πn`) separately — it needs a representation decision
(solution sets vs principal values) that was deliberately deferred in Track 2.

**Effort:** ~1 week. **Dependencies:** none — everything is landed.

### 2. ~~Interruptible evaluation~~ — ✅ done (2026-06-10)

**Outcome:** long-running evaluation loops now respect the engine deadline
(throwing `CancellationError`, same contract as `Factorial`/`Sum`):

- **Shared helper:** `checkDeadline(deadline)` in `src/common/interruptible.ts`
  (takes the absolute `ce._deadline`; strided in tight loops to amortize
  `Date.now()`).
- **Collection enumeration:** `BoxedFunction.each()` and `BoxedSymbol.each()`
  check every 256 items — one choke point covers Filter/Select/CountIf/
  Position/GroupBy, the set iterators, and cartesian-power enumeration
  (the `4099d2` hang class).
- **Number theory:** `Totient`, `Sigma0/1/−1`, `IsPerfect`, `IsAbundant`
  divisor loops, plus the `Eulerian`/`Stirling`/`NPartition` recursions.
- **Numeric `Limit`:** `extrapolate()` (Richardson) takes a `deadline`
  option, checked between function evaluations; `limit()` threads it;
  `Limit`/`NLimit` pass `engine._deadline`.
- **Quadrature:** `monteCarloEstimate()` checks every 1024 samples and
  *degrades gracefully* — it returns the estimate from the samples taken
  so far (with its larger error) rather than throwing, unless no samples
  were taken at all.

Coverage in `test/compute-engine/timeout.test.ts` (hang regression tests for
each family). **Residual — ✅ done (2026-06-12):** the Stage-2 watchdog,
`FUNGRIM_SKIP_IDS` denylist, and the structural representation/derivative
skips are retired; the harness runs the full {none, real-simple} slice
unattended (1,227 entries, 129 s, `ce.timeLimit = 1000` per evaluation).
Doing so exposed and fixed two more unbounded paths: nested numeric
integration through compiled code (`5b31ee`, ∫∫-Catalan — fixed by ambient
deadline inheritance in `interruptible.ts`) and symbolic differentiation
width blow-up (`8e8a59`, r-th derivative of LambertW, REVIEW.md G8 — fixed
by a strided deadline check in `differentiate()`). Entries with instances
380 → 622; True instances 1,089 → 1,363.

**Scope note — this item is the ENGINE evaluation loops only.** The Rubi
integration driver had its own unbounded paths this item does not cover; both
are now resolved (2026-06-13):
- The matcher (`scripts/rubi/match.ts`) is deadline-threaded (strided
  `checkDeadline` in `m()`; defensive — rarely blows up in practice).
- The minutes-long hangs (1.1.2.2#425 ran 422 s) were NOT a deadline gap but
  an **engine canonicalization infinite loop**: `factor()` → `mul(common,
  add(...))` → canonical `mul` re-distributes `common` → `toNumericValue` →
  `factor()` → … forever, on sums with irrational terms. `factor`
  (un-distribute) and canonical `mul` (distribute) are inverse operations
  with no fixed point on those forms. **Fixed** in `factor.ts`: build the
  factored product with a non-distributing `ce.function('Multiply', …)`
  instead of the expanding `mul()`. General engine fix (#425 422 s → 51 ms;
  full 1.1.2.2 section 1018/1071, slowest 9.5 s). Consequence: `factor()`
  now keeps radical content factored (`√3(√2x+x)` → `√3·x·(1+√2)`); affected
  simplify tests updated. Details in `docs/rubi/RUBI.md` §5.
- Related engine canonicalization fix the same day: `Power(u,-1/2)` now
  canonicalizes to `Divide(1, Sqrt(u))` (was a Power node, not unifying with
  `1/√u`), plus the `antiderivative()` recognizer matches the current
  `Divide(1,Sqrt(q))` form — recovers ∫1/√(1-x²)→arcsin and family.

### 3. ~~CI for the corpus pipeline~~ — ✅ done (2026-06-12)

**Outcome:** `corpus-pipeline` job in `.github/workflows/test.yml` with two
steps: (a) the Stage-1 box-check (`scripts/fungrim/validate.ts`, ~2 s, exit
gates on ≥99%); (b) `scripts/fungrim/artifact-freshness.ts` — recompiles a
deterministic 25-rule stride sample of the checked-in artifact through the
full compiler pipeline (guards, orientation, scratch-engine self-test) and
fails on any skip or field drift.

**Found on first wide run (150-sample):** `fungrim:7ea1ad`
(CarlsonRC(−1,1) specific value) failed self-test — the rule fired but
`isEqual` declared two *equal* complex constants unequal. Root cause:
`NumericValue.isZeroWithTolerance` hard-rejected any nonzero imaginary
part (`im !== 0 → false`), so a 1-ulp imaginary residue in the difference
made `eq()` return a definitive (unsound) `false`. Fixed in both
machine/big numeric values (tolerance now applies to the imaginary part
too); the 150-sample freshness run is clean.

---

## Medium-term

### 4. ~~Tier-2 numeric kernels for special functions~~ — ✅ done (2026-06-10)

**Outcome:** seven shell heads are now engine built-ins with numeric kernels,
in a new `special-functions` library (`library/special-functions.ts`),
following the B23 kernel pattern and the Fungrim conventions:

- **`EllipticK(m)` / `EllipticE(m)`** (parameter m = k², Fungrim
  `e8ae42`/`723fd0`): machine + bignum via the AGM (E via the cₙ-sum,
  A&S 17.6.4), complex kernels via the optimal-branch complex AGM (so
  K(m>1) returns the correct complex value). K(1) = +∞, E(1) = 1 exact.
- **`AGM(a, b)`** (and the 1-arg Fungrim shorthand `AGM(z)` = AGM(1, z)):
  machine + bignum + complex.
- **`Hypergeometric2F1(a,b,c,z)`**: terminating/polynomial cases, direct
  series, Pfaff z→z/(z−1), 1−z connection formula (generic case), Gauss
  summation at z = 1; machine + bignum (50-digit verified) + complex
  (|z| ≤ 0.8 ∪ Pfaff region).
- **`Hypergeometric1F1(a,b,z)`**: entire series + Kummer transformation
  for z < 0; machine + bignum + complex.
- **`JacobiTheta(j, z, τ)`** (Fungrim `f96eac`: q = e^{iπτ}, period 1 in z)
  and **`DedekindEta(τ)`** (`1dc520`): machine-complex q-series/products
  (envelope-based truncation; derivative order r > 0 stays symbolic).

Supporting work: `applyN()` dispatcher in `boxed-expression/apply.ts` with a
bignum → machine → complex NaN-cascade (a kernel returning NaN means
"outside my implemented domain", and the expression stays symbolic if all
kernels pass). Bignum series loops are deadline-checked (item 2). The
artifact loader skips its shells for these heads ("never widen"); the
declarations table re-prunes at the next artifact regen. ~60 reference-value
tests in `special-functions.test.ts`; Stage-1 corpus validation unchanged at
99.80%, all 1,376 rules load.

**Residual:** bignum kernels are real-argument only (complex falls back to
machine precision); ₂F₁ outside |z|<1 ∪ Pfaff region for complex z, the
degenerate integer-(c−a−b) connection case at z > 0.95, and theta
derivatives (r ≥ 1) stay symbolic. The z ≥ 1 part of this residual
is now a concrete blocker — see item 9.

**Payoff measured (2026-06-12):** of the 130 kernel-head entries in the
Stage-2 {none, real-simple} slice (all previously shell-head-skipped,
not-evaluable by construction), 117 now run and 115 instances verify True,
0 False (49 instances remain not-evaluable: other shell heads inside,
∫/lim representations beyond quadrature reach, theta derivative orders).
Measuring this also surfaced two real engine bugs, both fixed: `2^i`
canonicalized to `1` (exact-power fold ignored the imaginary part) and
`BoxedSymbol.N()` inverted `holdUntil: 'never'` (i/e/∞ never resolved
under `N()`).

### 10. ~~Unsound `x/√(x²) → 1` simplify rewrite~~ — ✅ done (2026-06-12)

**Outcome:** the culprit was `Product.mul()`
(`boxed-expression/arithmetic-mul-div.ts`): it folded
`(base^r)^e → base^(r·e)` unconditionally, so `x · (x²)^{−1/2}` collapsed
to `x⁰ = 1`. The fold is now gated by the same soundness conditions
`canonicalPower()`/`pow()` already used: outer exponent an integer, inner
exponent an odd integer (sign-preserving), or base known non-negative.

- Repro now stays sign-correct: `x/√(x²)` no longer simplifies to `1`
  (and still folds to `1` for a symbol assumed positive);
  `D(√(x²)).evaluate()` → `x/√(x²)` (= sign(x)).
- **Blast radius: zero** — the full suite shows no snapshot churn from
  this change (regression tests in `simplify.test.ts`, "SIGN-PRESERVING
  POWER FOLDING").
- Note: `√(x²) → |x|` still only fires at top level (simplify
  deliberately does not recurse into Divide/Multiply operands), so the
  repro keeps the `√(x²)` form rather than rewriting to `x/|x|`.

### 9. ~~₂F₁ analytic continuation for z ≥ 1~~ — ✅ done (2026-06-12)

**Outcome:** `hypergeometric2F1Complex` (`numerics/numeric-complex.ts`)
now covers (almost) the whole plane: it picks among the six Kummer maps
(direct, Pfaff z/(z−1), and the Γ-connection formulas in 1−z, 1/z,
1/(1−z), 1−1/z — A&S 15.3.4–15.3.9) the one with the smallest |w|,
accepting |w| ≤ 0.99 with a scaled term budget. Degenerate parameter
differences (a−b ∈ ℤ, c−a−b ∈ ℤ) route to a non-degenerate map when one
converges, else are handled by symmetric ±1e−6 parameter perturbation
(~1e−9 accuracy). On the cut z ∈ (1, ∞) the principal branch is the limit
from below (z − i0, matching mpmath/Mathematica) — implemented by forcing
`im = −0` so `atan2` lands on the right side. Real z > 1 reaches the
complex kernel through the existing applyN NaN-cascade; this also rescued
the old z ∈ (0.95, 1) degenerate-gap NaN. Machine precision against
mpmath on generic/degenerate/near-degenerate/cut/far-cut points
(`special-functions.test.ts`, "ANALYTIC CONTINUATION z ≥ 1").

**Residual:** a thin sliver around z = e^{±iπ/3} (all six maps have
|w| ≈ 1) stays NaN; doubly-degenerate near-singular points (e.g.
₂F₁(½,2;3/2;1.0001)) get ~1e−8 via the perturbation path; bignum kernel
remains real-axis z < 1 only.

**Benchmark note:** the 35 "not-evaluable" problems in the 1.1.1 sample
turned out to be mostly mistranslated inverse-hyperbolic names
(`Arcsinh`/`Artanh`… vs the engine's `Arsinh`/`Artanh` — fixed in
`scripts/rubi/wl-parser.ts`, corpus regenerated) plus incomplete elliptic
integrals, not ₂F₁; after the fixes the sample stands at **146 correct /
16 not-evaluable / 25 unsolved** (was 128/35/24). The remaining 16 are
EllipticF/EllipticPi (no kernels — future work) and 2 AppellF1 (item 13).

### 11. ~~Deadline checks in `simplify()`~~ — ✅ done (2026-06-12)

**Outcome:** `BoxedFunction.simplify()` now arms the engine deadline (same
`withDeadline` wrapper as `evaluate()`); `simplifyExpression()` (the
per-node choke point) and `polynomialDivide()` (the actual hot loop —
the cancel-common-factors rule's Euclidean `polynomialGCD` on
radical-coefficient polynomials ran minutes per call) check it. The rule
engine's catch-all handlers in `rules.ts` rethrow `CancellationError`
instead of swallowing timeouts as "rule failed". A previously-minutes-long
`Divide` of two expanded `(√2·x+√c)ⁿ` polynomials now throws
`CancellationError` at `ce.timeLimit` (coverage in `timeout.test.ts`,
"Simplify"). Rubi-side: `SIMPLIFY_LEAF_CAP` raised 120 → 500 and
`safeSimplify` catches the cancellation (fail-closed, unsimplified), so
predicates no longer trade correctness for time.

### 12. ~~`antiderivative.ts` correctness fixes~~ — ✅ done (2026-06-12)

**Outcome (regression tests in `calculus.test.ts`, "INTEGRATION
REGRESSIONS"):**

- **a-term drop:** root cause was an *engine* bug, not just integration:
  `polynomialGCD` treated a null coefficient extraction (Euclid remainders
  with parameter-divided coefficients like `(a/b)x²`) as "zero polynomial",
  returning a non-divisor as the GCD (gcd(a+bx⁴, x⁶) → `x⁴ + a/b`);
  `cancelCommonFactors` then cancelled with it, silently dropping terms.
  Fixed both (null → gcd 1; cancel now verifies zero remainders), and
  added a last-resort term-wise numerator split in the `Divide` branch
  (only accepted when every sub-integral resolves). `∫(a+b·x⁴)/x⁶` →
  `−a/(5x⁵) − b/x`.
- **Incomplete partial fractions:** the simple-poles branch applied the
  cover-up formula even when the real roots didn't account for the full
  denominator degree (1−x⁶: dropped both irreducible quadratics) and
  ignored the leading coefficient (∫1/(2x²−2) was ×2 off). Now gated on
  full degree and uses residues Aᵢ = 1/Q′(rᵢ). A new
  `numericPartialFractions` fallback (Durand–Kerner roots over
  numeric-coefficient denominators; conjugate pairs → log + arctan; the
  decomposition is verified a-posteriori at off-root test points)
  completes `∫x⁶/(1−x⁶)`, `∫1/(x⁴+1)`, and expanded repeated-root
  denominators like `1/(x²−2x+1)`.
- **Stack overflows:** two runaway recursions fixed — Case A
  "divide first" looped when the denominator was x-free (quotient
  re-canonicalizes to the same `Divide(P, c)` shape), and when symbolic
  cancellation left the remainder's degree structurally unreduced
  (coefficients algebraically zero but not structurally). All six
  `RangeError` problems from the ch1-500 baseline now terminate (inert).
- **156 s problem:** gone — re-run of the seed-42 ch1-500 baseline:
  max problem time 156 s → 3.6 s, errors 6 → 4 (1 RangeError remains on a
  *symbolic-exponent* integrand `x^m(a+bx^(2+2m))²` — different bug class;
  3 are `CancellationError` timeouts, i.e. bounded by design), correct
  13 → 18, wrong 3 → 2 (both residual "wrong" are verification artifacts:
  `1/x¹⁰⁰` central-difference overflow near 0, and one correct-but-
  unverifiable form).
- **Symbolic-exponent RangeError (residual, fixed 2026-06-12):** the
  by-parts depth cap was defeated because `antiderivativeWithByParts`
  falls back into the full `antiderivative()`, re-entering by-parts with
  a fresh depth of 0 — and symbolic exponents provide no shrinking
  measure along that cycle. Three fixes: a module-level cap on TOTAL
  by-parts stack frames; folding products of index powers with symbolic
  exponents (`x^m·x^(2m+2) → x^(3m+2)` — canonicalization only folds
  numeric ones); and an expand-and-integrate fallback tried AFTER
  by-parts (so existing antiderivative forms are unchanged).
  `∫x^m(a+bx^(2+2m))² dx` now solves and D-verifies. ch1-500 re-run:
  correct 13 → 37, wrong → 1, errors → 3 (all `CancellationError`
  timeouts — zero RangeErrors).

### 13. ~~Small engine follow-ups (batch)~~ — ✅ done (2026-06-12)

- **`ce.number()` malformed input** — ✅: a malformed *array* argument
  (anything but a 2-element number/bigint pair, e.g. the MathJSON
  expression `['Rational', 1, 2]`) now throws with a pointer to
  `ce.box()`. Non-array objects (`{re, im}`, `{rational}` shapes) still
  fall through to `_numericValue` as before. Tests in
  `expression-api.test.ts`.
- **`AppellF1` numeric kernel** — ✅: machine + complex double-Pochhammer
  series (`appellF1` in `numerics/special-functions.ts`,
  `appellF1Complex` in `numerics/numeric-complex.ts`), |x|,|y| < 1 plus
  terminating-index extensions; declared in `library/special-functions.ts`
  with the applyN cascade; mpmath-validated tests in
  `special-functions.test.ts`.
- **Polynomial helpers / parameter-divided coefficients** — deferred
  (optional, snapshot-review risk). The dangerous interaction — Euclid
  remainders with such coefficients corrupting `polynomialGCD` — is fixed
  by the item-12 null-guard; migrating the Rubi layer's x-aware versions
  into `polynomials.ts` remains available if a consumer needs the
  tolerance.

**Discovered along the way (Rubi scripts layer):** the WL translator
mapped the inverse hyperbolic heads to nonexistent engine symbols
(`ArcSinh → Arcsinh` instead of `Arsinh`, etc.), which silently never
evaluated — this, not ₂F₁, was most of the 1.1.1 "not-evaluable" bucket.
Fixed in `scripts/rubi/wl-parser.ts`; chapter-1 corpus regenerated
(name-only diff). Remaining not-evaluable results are incomplete elliptic
integrals (`EllipticF`/`EllipticPi` kernels — candidate next item).

### 14. ~~Incomplete elliptic integrals via Carlson symmetric forms~~ — ✅ done (2026-06-12)

**Outcome:** machine-real + complex Carlson kernels
`carlsonRF/RC/RD/RJ` (`numerics/special-functions.ts`,
`numerics/numeric-complex.ts`) — duplication-theorem algorithms with
mpmath's series tails; RC gets a small-|y−x| series fast path (the
acos/acosh forms lose half the digits near degeneracy, which capped R_J
at ~4e-11; now ~1e-15); real R_J/R_C return Cauchy principal values for
negative `p`/`y` (DLMF 19.20.14 / 19.2.20); complex R_J only evaluates
the configurations where duplication is valid (mpmath's criterion), NaN
otherwise. On top of these: `EllipticF(φ,m)` (new head),
`EllipticE(φ,m)` (second optional argument on the existing head),
`EllipticPi(n,m)` / `EllipticPi(n,φ,m)` (new head) — Mathematica
argument conventions, parameter m = k², quasi-periodic extension beyond
|Re φ| > π/2, applyN machine→complex cascade. Validated against mpmath
1.4 (worst rel. err. ~1e-15 machine, ~7e-16 complex, including the Rubi
corpus shapes: m > 1, m < 0, complex amplitudes from ArcSin(s>1));
mpmath-derived tests in `special-functions.test.ts`. The Fungrim
artifact was regenerated (EllipticPi shell pruned now that it is a
built-in; rule set byte-identical otherwise).

**Measured effect (Rubi 1.1.1 seed-42 200-sample, with the scripts-layer
`posAux` Divide fix in the same session):** solved-correct 146 → 161
(73% → 80.5%), not-evaluable 16 → 4 (remaining: one AppellF1 outside the
|y| < 1 kernel domain, two integrands with an empty real domain that the
sampling verifier cannot evaluate anywhere, one ArcTanh real-domain
gap), solved-wrong 4 → 1 (the survivor is the `1/x¹⁰⁰` central-difference
verification artifact — the antiderivative is correct).

**Known gap (pre-existing, separate):** CE's `Arcsin(x).N()` returns NaN
for real |x| > 1 instead of continuing to the complex value, so
`EllipticF(ArcSin(1.2), m)` only evaluates where the amplitude is real.
The kernels themselves handle complex amplitudes (validated directly).

### 15. ~~Fractional-power principal-branch soundness in `Product`~~ — ✅ done (2026-06-12)

**What:** the Rubi 1.1.1 benchmark (quartic-root elliptic chains,
`∫1/(√(a+bx)·(c+dx)^(3/4))`) exposed a family of unsound rewrites in
`Product` (`boxed-expression/arithmetic-mul-div.ts`) that silently move
negative signs and factors across fractional powers — each one a complex
phase error (`(−u)^(1/4) ≠ −u^(1/4)`; the −1 is `e^{iπ/4}`):

- **`Product.mul` Negate branch** extracted `−1` from `(−u)^exp`
  regardless of `exp` (also wrong for even integer exponents). Now: odd
  integer → sign flip, even integer → no flip, fractional → the `Negate`
  term is tallied opaquely.
- **Coefficient extraction** (`toNumericValue` + `coef.pow(exp)`)
  applied NumericValue's real-root convention to negative coefficients
  under even fractional powers. Now gated (`evenRootOfNegative`).
- **`toNumericValue` Root branch** (`boxed-function.ts`): same
  real-root-convention extraction for even roots of negative
  coefficients — now returns the expression unsplit. (`Sqrt` is exempt:
  `NumericValue.sqrt` returns the principal imaginary value.)
- **`Product.mul` Divide branch** split `(u/v)^r → u^r·v^(−r)` for
  fractional `r` with unknown-sign `v` (phase conjugation when `v < 0`).
  Now split only for integer `r` or known non-negative `v`.
- **`groupedByDegrees`** merged same-exponent terms `u^r·v^r → (uv)^r`
  for fractional `r` regardless of signs. Now merged only for integer
  exponents or known non-negative terms (groups created by an
  unmergeable term are sealed).

**Blast radius: zero** — full suite green, no snapshot churn, numeric
checks like `(−16)^(1/4)·81^(1/4)` now return the principal complex
value consistently.

**Found via** per-problem rule-chain triage (`scripts/rubi/triage.ts`,
new) of the 1.1.1 sample's solved-wrong bucket. The remaining Rubi-side
elliptic phase mismatches (3 problems/200) are a Rubi-layer follow-on
(`docs/rubi/RUBI.md`), not an engine soundness issue.

### 16. ~~`factor()`↔`mul` canonicalization loop + `x^(-1/2)` unification~~ — ✅ done (2026-06-13)

**What:** the Rubi exhaustive-run blockers (1.1.2/1.1.3 problems hanging
2–12 min, worst 736 s) and the broken ∫1/√(1-x²)→arcsin family turned out to
be two general engine canonicalization bugs:

- **Infinite loop between `factor()` and canonical `mul`.** `Product.mul` →
  `toNumericValue()` on an `Add` → `factor()` (to pull out common factors) →
  `factor` returned `mul(common, add(newTerms))`, but canonical `mul`
  **re-distributed** `common` back over the sum, reproducing the original
  `Add` → `toNumericValue` → `factor` → … forever, on sums with irrational
  terms (e.g. `½·x·√(a+bx²) + a·artanh(…)/(2√b)`). `factor` (un-distribute)
  and `mul` (distribute) are inverses with no fixed point. **Fix:** `factor()`
  builds the factored product with a non-distributing
  `ce.function('Multiply', …)` instead of the expanding `mul()`. Found via
  engine-primitive probing + a deep-recursion stack dump (the "current op"
  flipped between `canonicalMultiply`/`canonicalAdd` every run — the tell of
  mutual recursion). **Effect: 1.1.2.2#425 422 s → 51 ms; full 1.1.2.2
  section 1018/1071, 0 errors, slowest 9.5 s.** Consequence: `factor()` now
  also keeps radical content factored (`√3(√2x+x)` → `√3·x·(1+√2)`, not
  `(√3+√6)x`) — a deliberate direction change (aligns with the `factor()`
  test.todo); affected simplify snapshots/assertions updated.
- **`x^(-1/2)` did not unify with `1/√x`.** `Power(u,-1/2)` stayed a Power
  node while `1/√u`, `√u^(-1)`, `1/u^(1/2)` all canonicalized to
  `Divide(1, Sqrt(u))`, so `D(arcsin x) = (1-x²)^(-1/2)` did not match the
  integrand `1/√(1-x²)`, and `antiderivative()` returned it unevaluated.
  **Fix:** `arithmetic-power.ts` canonicalizes negative unit-fraction
  exponents `a^(-1/n) → 1/Root(a, n)` (branch-safe on the principal branch),
  and `antiderivative.ts`'s ∫1/√(quadratic) recognizer now matches the
  current `Divide(1, Sqrt(q))` form (it only knew the old `Sqrt(1/q)` form
  the `1/√u → √(1/u)` fold used to produce before that fold was gated for
  soundness — item 15 family). Recovers arcsin/arsinh/arcosh.

**Blast radius:** small — full suite green apart from the deliberately-updated
radical-simplify snapshots/assertions and one unrelated OEIS network test.
Both bugs were general (any consumer constructing such expressions hit them),
surfaced by Rubi. Details in `docs/rubi/RUBI.md` §5.

### 5. Per-head aggregated rule dispatch

**What:** close the loaded-simplify benchmark gap: with the 1,376-rule
artifact, `simplify()` over the reference corpus runs at ~1.58× the unloaded
baseline (target ≤1.5×; Phase 1's 558 rules ran at 1.16×). The residual cost
is per-rule `applyRule`/`candidateRules` scaffolding for the ~60 wrapper
consultations per arithmetic node.

**How:** aggregate hot-head rules into one dispatcher per head. This was
deliberately not done in the loader because it conflicts with the pinned
contract that `ce.simplificationRules.length` reflects per-rule registration
and each rule's `fungrim:` id surfaces in simplify steps — so it needs a small
design first (e.g. dispatcher-level step attribution, or relaxing the count
contract). The loader's pre-screen machinery (rarity-ranked required-feature
sets, WeakMap-memoized per-expression feature sets in
`src/compute-engine/fungrim/loader.ts`) carries over unchanged.

**Effort:** ~3–5 days once the observability design is settled.

### 6. ~~Corpus refresh from live fungrim.org + upstream contributions~~ — ✅ done / moot (2026-06-10)

**Outcome:** the premise was refuted — upstream `fredrik-johansson/fungrim`
has not moved since the original snapshot (verified by recursive diff during
fork setup), so there is nothing newer to refresh from. What was done instead:

- Translator published in the fork [`arnog/fungrim`](https://github.com/arnog/fungrim)
  (default branch `grim2mathjson`; `master` tracks upstream).
- The two upstream bug families reported as issues **and** fixed via PRs
  (Equal-paren in `6c2b31`/`e54e61` — duplicating the author's own forgotten
  2022 PR #29 — and `Element(w, tau)` ×24 in `jacobi_theta.py`), each fix
  numerically verified at 30 digits.
- Fix commits merged into the fork's `grim2mathjson` branch; corpus
  regenerated (26 entries improved, Stage-1 99.80%, artifact 1,350 → 1,376
  rules); `MANIFEST.json` records the patched-fork provenance.

**Residual (maintenance, not roadmap):** if upstream ever merges the PRs or
revives, rebase the fork and regenerate — the workflow is documented in
`data/fungrim/README.md`.

## Strategic

### 7. Fungrim Phase 4 — the analytic-property metadata store

**What:** `data/fungrim/properties.json` ships 131 extracted records — poles,
zeros, branch points, branch cuts, residues, holomorphic domains, keyed by
operator — that nothing consumes yet. Build the per-operator metadata store
sketched in `docs/fungrim/FUNGRIM.md` §4 Feature E: `ce.functionProperties('Gamma').poles →
ℤ≤0`-style queries feeding (a) branch-cut-safe simplification guards, (b)
pole-aware `N()` (return `ComplexInfinity` at poles instead of garbage), and
(c) the foundation for symbolic limits and residues — the next genuinely new
capability class for the engine.

**Effort:** the store + (b) is ~1 week; (a) and (c) are open-ended design
work. Start by defining the query API and wiring `Gamma`/`Zeta` poles into
`N()`.

### 8. Disjunctive guards (`Or`) in the assumptions system

**What:** 87 complex-domain corpus entries remain undischargeable because
their guards are `Or`-rooted (the assumptions design deliberately scoped
disjunction out — see `docs/fungrim/FUNGRIM-PLAN-3-ASSUMPTIONS.md` §7 non-goals). The
remaining ~43 failures are symbolic bounds (`|z| < φ−1`), which the
assume-side decomposition deliberately drops.

**Why "strategic":** disjunctive facts are a real design extension (case
splitting or watched-disjunct propagation), not an incremental patch. The
guard census (`scripts/fungrim/guard-census.json`, currently 89.6%
complex-domain dischargeable) quantifies exactly what it would buy. Let
demand justify it.

## Documentation

- **`doc/14-guide-assumptions.md`** predates the Track-3 extension — document
  part-predicates (`assume(Re(s) > 1)`, `Im(τ) > 0`, `|q| < 1`),
  `NotEqual`/`SetMinus` domains, `And` conjunctions, the `'not-a-predicate'`
  result, and the three-valued discharge semantics.
- **`doc/15-guide-patterns-and-rules.md`** — document the new `Rule.purpose`
  tags (`simplify`/`transform`/`expand`), the `operators` dispatch hint, and
  `ce.solveRules`/`ce.harmonizationRules`.
- **`doc/15b-guide-extended-rules.md`** (new this release) — revisit the
  performance numbers if dispatch work (item 5) lands.
- If Tycho/GP consumes this release: add a `loadIdentities` section to the
  importer guide in the Tycho repo (consumer-facing docs live with the
  consumer).

## Review residue (carried from REVIEW.md, June 2026)

The June 2026 codebase review (REVIEW.md) is fully dispositioned; its full
text is preserved in git history. The only items deliberately left open:

- **A14 (LOW, deferred)** — `boxed-expression/order.ts` tie-breaks: operator
  and string branches sort descending while the symbol branch and doc comment
  say ascending. Deferred because forcing ascending changes established
  canonical orderings in a debatably *worse* direction (e.g. `-(sech x ·
  tanh x)` instead of the textbook `-(tanh x · sech x)`) and churns
  calculus/derivatives snapshots. The right resolution — which branch to align,
  or whether to encode the textbook ordering explicitly — is a deliberate
  canonical-form design choice, not a bug fix.
- **G5 (LOW, deferred)** — `["Subscript", "a", "k"]` canonicalizes to the
  fused symbol `a_k`, severing the binding when `k` is a binder-bound index.
  A correct fix needs binder-aware canonicalization (the canonicalizer has no
  enclosing-binder scope at fusion time) — too broad for a LOW finding. The
  documented workaround is the call form `["a_", "k"]` (which the Fungrim
  corpus uses).
- **collections.test.ts** — 3 `@fixme`-annotated Take/Drop/Slice matrix
  snapshots, known failing.
- **G7 / A15** — resolved by intervening work; G7 (bound-variable identity
  stability across re-boxing) is a regression-coverage candidate: it now
  passes but has no dedicated test pinning it.

Lessons from the review worth keeping in mind (the durable ones are in
CLAUDE.md): the `undefined → false` collapse in three-valued predicates was
the single most recurring bug class (A3, G3, the sets/Union/Range contains
family, NaN comparisons); validation-by-corpus (the Fungrim harness) found
15 engine bugs that targeted review missed — keep running it.

## Benchmark findings (June 2026)

Surfaced by the cross-library benchmark in [`benchmarks/`](./benchmarks/)
(CE vs SymPy / math.js / NumPy — see `benchmarks/REPORT.md`). Each is reproduced
against the current build and verified numerically with `mpmath`. None are
regressions vs `0.59.0`; they are pre-existing gaps the suite made visible.

### B1. Special-function `N()` does not honor requested precision

- **`Zeta` — the worst case.** `ζ(3)` at `ce.precision = 40` is correct to only
  **~16 digits** then diverges (CE `…159594223…` vs true `…159594285…`); at
  precision 60 it reaches only ~22. The numeric path is effectively
  double-precision regardless of `ce.precision`.
- **`Gamma` — milder but real.** `Γ(1/3)` delivers ~38 of 40 requested digits
  (~50 of 60), and is **~10× slower than SymPy** per call (the one numeric case
  in the suite where a competitor beats CE on speed).

**Fix direction:** route `Zeta`/`Gamma` `N()` through arbitrary-precision
kernels (cf. item 4) honoring `ce.precision` with guard digits. Overlaps item 7's
"pole-aware `N()`" — worth doing together when touching these heads.

### B2. Symbolic (indefinite) integration coverage gaps

- **Fractional-power / radical integrands return unevaluated** — `∫1/√x`, `∫√x`,
  `∫x²/√(1−x²)`, `∫x/√(1−x²)`: the power rule isn't applied to fractional
  exponents and radical substitutions are missing. All are solved by the
  experimental Rubi path **and** by SymPy, so the `CE·cur` vs `CE+R/F` gap in the
  report quantifies exactly what's missing from the built-in integrator.
- **Non-elementary results not produced** — `∫e^(−x²)` (erf), `∫sin x/x` (Si),
  `∫sec³x` come back unevaluated; SymPy returns erf/Si.
- **Machine floats leak into otherwise-correct symbolic results** — `∫1/(x³+1)`
  → `0.333…·ln|x+1| + 0.577…·…` instead of exact `⅓` and `√3/3`. The value is
  right but the form has float coefficients where exact rationals/radicals
  belong. (`antiderivative.ts` — likely the partial-fraction coefficient path.)
- **Nested radicals not denested** — `√(3+2√2)` stays as-is; SymPy gives `1+√2`
  (`sqrtdenest`). Lower priority.

### B3. Definite / improper integrals are numerical-only

- Even elementary definite integrals return a **numerical** value with an error
  estimate rather than the exact closed form: `∫₀¹ x² dx → 0.333157 ± 9e-5`
  (not `1/3`). There is no symbolic definite path (antiderivative + bound
  substitution).
- **Oscillatory improper integrals diverge** — `∫₀^∞ cos(x²) dx → −1.6 ± 1.8`
  (true `√(π/8) ≈ 0.627`); the numerical quadrature mishandles conditionally-
  convergent oscillatory integrands. `∫₀^∞ e^(−x²)` lands at `0.886 ± …`
  (~4-digit) — close, but still numerical.

**Fix direction:** add a symbolic definite path (antiderivative + bound
substitution, with endpoint-limit handling for improper bounds) before the
quadrature fallback; harden the oscillatory quadrature.

### B4. `Factor` emits non-polynomial radical/abs forms for `xⁿ − 1`

`Factor` applies a difference-of-even-powers trick that injects `√x`/`|x|` for
odd exponents, producing factorizations that are value-equal on `x > 0` but are
**not polynomial** and are branch-dependent:

| input | CE | correct (SymPy) |
|---|---|---|
| `x³ − 1` | `(x·√x − 1)(x·√x + 1)` | `(x − 1)(x² + x + 1)` |
| `x⁶ − 1` | `(\|x\|³ − 1)(\|x\|³ + 1)` | `(x − 1)(x + 1)(x² − x + 1)(x² + x + 1)` |
| `x⁷ − 1` | `(√x·\|x\|³ − 1)(√x·\|x\|³ + 1)` | `(x − 1)(x⁶ + x⁵ + … + 1)` |

`x² − 1`, `x⁴ − 1` and perfect squares are fine. `Factor` of a polynomial should
return polynomial factors (cyclotomic for `xⁿ − 1`); the even-power heuristic
must be gated to actual perfect-power exponents and not introduce `Sqrt`/`Abs`.

### B5. No public polynomial GCD

`["GCD", p, q]` on polynomials returns **unevaluated** (`gcd(x²+3x+2, x²+4x+3)`;
the answer is `x + 1`). The engine has an internal `polynomialGCD` (used by
cancellation) but nothing surfaces it as an operator — so polynomial GCD, and
benchmarks that rely on it (e.g. the Fateman GCD benchmark), can't run on CE.
Expose `GCD`/`PolynomialGCD` over polynomials.

**Resolved:** `PolynomialGCD(p, q, x)` was already exposed; the variadic `GCD`
operator now also computes a univariate polynomial GCD when the operands share
a non-trivial common factor (variable inferred), e.g. `GCD(x²+3x+2, x²+4x+3)`
→ `x+1`. A trivial (constant) GCD is deferred to preserve the integer-GCD
reading of a bare symbol — `GCD(x, 6)` stays unevaluated; use `PolynomialGCD`
for the coprime → 1 answer. Multivariate GCD remains out of scope (see B6).

### B6. (next) Multi-operation audit vs SymPy

Planned: a broad CE-vs-SymPy audit covering **integration** (Bondarenko 35 +
the other independent suites, ingested via `scripts/rubi/wl-parser.ts`),
**factoring**, **polynomial GCD** (with the Fateman benchmark as the headline
perf case — Symbolica 4 s / Mathematica 89 s / SymPy 61 min), **simplification**
and **expansion**, graded for correctness + performance and ranked by where CE
trails. A full broad-correctness pass will also fold in the Wester test suite
(being sourced separately, in Maxima form). Expected to expand B1–B5.
