# Cortex Language

Cortex is a text-syntax programming language for scientific computing whose
intermediate representation is MathJSON, evaluated by the Compute Engine
(language design in `src/cortex/docs/*.md`; see the
[language review](./language-review.md) for its consistency state and gaps).

Cortex shipped as an **experimental** entry point
`@cortex-js/compute-engine/cortex` on 2026-07-09 — all phases (0–5) of the
2026-07-05 revival are complete. What genuinely remains is the
[Roadmap](#roadmap) below. History — the audit that started the revival, the
inventory snapshot, the per-phase completion log, and the per-phase design
documents — lives in [`STATUS_REPORT.md`](./STATUS_REPORT.md).

Public API:

- `parseCortex(source, url?) → [MathJsonExpression, ParsingDiagnostic[]]`
- `serializeCortex(expr, options?) → string`
- `executeCortex(ce, source, options?) → { value, diagnostics }`

## Architecture decisions (2026-07-05)

1. **Type annotations reuse the engine's type language.**
   `src/common/type/` (hand-written `Lexer` + recursive-descent `Parser`)
   is used as a subparser in annotation positions (`x: real`, function
   signatures). It needs a prefix-parse API (parse from an offset, report
   the end, no EOF requirement) and thrown-error → diagnostic bridging.
   Type-syntax tokens (`<`, `>`, `->`, `|`, `&`) never enter the expression
   grammar.
2. **The loose `ce.parse()` is NOT the expression parser — align with it
   instead.** The non-strict AsciiMath/Typst grammar is a math-notation
   parser over a LaTeX token model (unknown multi-letter identifiers split
   into letter products: `foo` → `f·o·o`; `&&`, `in`, `0x1F`, strings,
   comments are foreign to it). Instead: (i) keep Cortex syntax
   *compatible* where the grammars overlap (`**`, `|>`, `[1,2,3]`,
   `f(x,y)`, bare function names); (ii) reuse dictionary *data* and
   `serialize-number`; (iii) **`$...$` LaTeX islands**: a `$...$` span is a
   primary expression — its contents are parsed as LaTeX by an *injected*
   parser (mirroring the engine's `ILatexSyntax` injection pattern) and the
   resulting MathJSON is spliced into the Cortex AST like any other operand
   (`2 * $\frac{1}{2}$` → `["Multiply", 2, ["Divide", 1, 2]]`). Islands
   parse raw/structural by default (Cortex owns canonicalization); island
   diagnostics must be offset-mapped into the Cortex source.
3. **`point-free-parser` is retired.** The Cortex parser is a hand-written
   `Lexer` + Pratt/recursive-descent parser in the house style of
   `src/common/type/lexer.ts`/`parser.ts`, with diagnostic accumulation +
   panic-mode recovery (always a partial AST + diagnostics — never
   throw-on-first-error) and source ranges on every node. The working
   lexical layer, the `characters.ts` Unicode tables, and the
   `ParsingDiagnostic`/fix-it types were ported; the combinator machinery
   was deleted.

## Roadmap

The revival (phases 0–5) is complete and shipped; this is the backlog of what
genuinely remains. It is the single list of open Cortex work — items leave it
once they land, and the record moves to the completed log in
[`STATUS_REPORT.md`](./STATUS_REPORT.md). None of these block use of the
experimental entry point; they are gated on demand from the first consumer
(Cortex fragments in Tycho notebooks). Effort tags: S small / M medium / L
large.

### Release-protocol (do at/around each release)

- **Docs sync (S).** Route `src/cortex/docs/` through the normal `doc/`
  workflow to cortexjs.io at release time (never edit cortexjs.io directly).
  Before syncing: fill `naming.md` (language-review §2.10), add the "Future
  directions" non-goals section to `cortex.md` (§2.12 — `match`, modules,
  `try`/`catch`, `async`, macros are reserved words, *not designed*), and do a
  final grammar pass on `syntax.md`.
- **Highlight-mode revalidation (S).** `highlight-js-mode.js` was rebuilt
  and statically validated 2026-07-11 (see its header); highlight.js is not
  a devDependency, so re-run the header's structural check whenever the
  grammar changes. Deriving a CodeMirror grammar for Tycho remains a
  Tycho-side item, gated on demand.

### Findings from the example programs (2026-07-10)

The examples sweep (`test/cortex/programs.test.ts` / `docs/examples.md`)
surfaced engine bugs and Cortex gaps. Already **fixed** (see the completed
log in `STATUS_REPORT.md`): the canonical-fold value-leak (`Divide(2, x)` →
`2` while `x` held `1`), the `String(…)` concatenation bug (interpolation
now works, incl. the `cortex.md` headline example), the `Type` operator
reporting `unknown` for lazy operands, silent indexed assignment
(`xs[2] = 9` now emits a `runtime-error` diagnostic — as does any non-final
statement that evaluates to an error value), and — 2026-07-11 — recursion
knot-tying (one-step `f(n) = …` now works), chained indexing `m[2][1]`,
the builtins batch (`Pipe` evaluation, `Append`, `Fold`, `StringJoin`,
`RandomInteger`), and the lazy-collections decision (**ratified: literals
are values, pipelines are generators** — `List`/`Dictionary` literals
evaluate their elements like `Set`/`Tuple` always did; lazy operators keep
late binding, documented as generator semantics in `evaluation.md`).

All engine-side findings from the sweep are closed; the section that
mirrored them in the repo-root `ROADMAP.md` has been retired.

### Findings from the examples sweep 3 (2026-07-11)

A third exploration wave (control flow/predicates, integers/strings, math
depth) added 18 programs to the suite (now 68) and surfaced seven engine
bugs, all **fixed same day** (see CHANGELOG `[Unreleased]`): dictionary-`At`
value typing, big-integer truncation in tensor-promoted list literals,
`Reduce`/`Fold` float fast-path exactness + imaginary-part drop, `Map`
element-type inference, `StringFrom` broadcast pre-empting its collection
join, non-exact `e^{iθ}` for constructible angles, and one-step function
definitions not binding inside applied function bodies.

Residuals (engine, small):

- **`StringFrom` still doesn't join a *lazy* collection (S).**
  `StringFrom(Map(UnicodeScalars(s), …), "unicode-scalars")` returns `""` —
  the `isIndexedCollection` guard rejects the unmaterialized `Map`. The eager
  loop-built list works (that form is in the examples). Materialize finite
  lazy arguments instead.
- **Exact big integers can serialize in exponent form (S).** `Fold`-computed
  `25!` prints as `15511210043330985984e+6` and `String(100!)` uses
  scientific notation, so string-based digit manipulation silently loses
  zeros. The values are exact; only the default integer serialization
  collapses trailing digits.
- **`Solve` on inequalities returns `[]` (M).** `Solve(x^2 < 4, x)` reads as
  "no solutions" when it means "unsupported" — should stay inert (or
  eventually solve inequalities).

Language-design candidates (decide when demand appears):

- **Lowercase `true`/`false` (S — design).** They are undeclared symbols
  today, so `false && …` stays inert with no diagnostic; every other keyword
  is lowercase. Alias to `True`/`False`?
- **ASCII `..` range operator (S — design).** Only the Unicode `‥` (U+2025)
  is mapped; programs must write `Range(a, b)`.
- **`StringJoin` over a list (S — design).** Varargs only, which blocks
  `StringJoin(Reverse(Characters(s)))`; accept a single list argument?
- **Discoverability aliases (S — design).** `Quotient` (integer division),
  `Arg` (engine op is `Argument`), `Quartile` (`Quartiles`) all stay silently
  symbolic when guessed.

### Semantics gaps shipped as v0 caveats (complete on demand)

- **Enforce typed function params (M).** `f(x: integer) = …` parses and holds
  the annotation but `executeCortex` does not enforce it at call time — wire
  the annotation into parameter binding.
- **Comment fidelity through serialize (M).** Comments are dropped on
  serialize (documented lossy in `comments.md`); preserve them if round-trip
  fidelity is required for the notebook use case.
- **Mutual recursion in one-step definitions (M — on demand).** One-step
  self-recursion works (2026-07-11), but two functions defined in terms of
  each other still need `let` declarations first; a one-step form would
  require forward-declaring sibling references.
- **String concatenation stays interpolation + `StringJoin` (decided
  2026-07-11).** No `+` overload or dedicated operator; `"a" + "b"` remains
  a type error by design.

### Language-design candidates from the examples sweep 2 (2026-07-11)

Found while writing the second examples wave; each is a design decision, not
a bug — decide when Tycho demand appears:

- **Unit-literal notation (M — design).** Cortex has no native unit syntax:
  bare `km` is a free symbol. Units are expressible today via `$…$` LaTeX
  islands (`$30\,\mathrm{km/h}$`) or `Quantity(30, "km/h")`. A first-class
  unit literal (e.g. `30 `km/h``?) needs a grammar decision.
- **Block-expression closure bodies (M — design).** `{…}` in expression
  position is a set literal, so a stateful `makeCounter`-style closure (a
  lambda whose body is a statement block) is not expressible; pure
  capturing closures work.

### Serializer / compile-target polish

- **Python compile-target tails (M).** The Cortex→engine lowering currently
  fails closed in the Python target on `Comprehension`, stepped/descending
  `Range`, and multi-`Element` `Loop`; implement these when a Cortex program
  needs them.
